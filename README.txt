This app integrates AquaTemp wifi module-equipped pool heatpumps with your Homey system, allowing full control and monitoring from anywhere.

If you are upgrading from a version before 1.1.0 then you might need to uninstall and reinstall the app.
This is due to changes in the login system. Username and password are now linked directly with each device
and not an app wide account. This is done to support multiple devices with different accounts.
If you have used the app in flows, those will need to be updated as well. Sorry for the inconvenience.

With this app you can:
- Check inlet, outlet and outside temperature in real-time
- Monitor water flow through the heatpump to prevent issues
- Track power consumption, voltage and current on power supply
- Control operation (start/stop, silent mode), set pool temperature, and switch between heating/cooling modes

Easily create Homey flows to automate your pool heating based on time, temperature or other conditions for maximum efficiency and comfort.

Simple setup process gets you connected quickly with your existing AquaTemp equipment.
